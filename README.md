# from-function-explained-python

Key Points:

Selective Importing: from allows you to import only what you need from a module, making your code more efficient and clear.

Namespace Management: By importing specific items, you avoid cluttering your namespace with unnecessary names, reducing the risk of conflicts.

Readability: Using from can improve code readability by making it clear exactly which components are being used from a module.
